<!-- STREAMS -->

basically streams are used to read or write sequentially. so when we have to handle and manipulate streaming data.e.g continious source or big files

There are four different types of streams

1. Readable => used to read data sequentially
2. Writable => used to write data sequentially
3. Duplex => used to both read and write data sequentially
4. Transform => when data can be modified when writing or reading sequentially
